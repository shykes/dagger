## What is Dagger?

Dagger is a programmable pipeline platform. It complements a team's existing CI/CD and development tools, by integrating them all into a unified API that everyone in the team can interact with, in the programming language of their choice.

## Why Dagger?


Dagger solves the problem of CI/CD being an opaque monolith (collaboration problem), and pipelines not being able to run locally (shift left).

By adopting Dagger, a software team can upgrade their CI/CD to being an accelerator instead of slowing them down - without requiring an expensive replatform project.

## How does it work?

Dagger is a CI/CD <QUALIFIER> that <accelerates> by <meeting your developers where they are>

- <QUALIFIER>: makes it clear that we improve your existing CI/CD without replacing it.
    NOT A RIP AND REPLACE!
    candidates:
        - accelerator
        - supercharger
        - add-on
        - enhancer
        - extension
        - modifier
        - complement
        - companion
        - copilot

## Key Features


    1. COLLABORATION
        (accelerating humans)
        (for teams using CI)

        - Program pipelines together

        - Debug together

    2. PERFORMANCE
        (accelerating machines)
        (for tems running CI)


* Programmable
* **Instant local testing**
* **Portability**: the same pipeline can run on your local machine, a CI runner, a dedicated server, or any container hosting service.

## Why Dagger?

Your CI/CD is slowing you down, but it should be accelerating you.

* NOT A RIP AND REPLACE: Improve your existing CI/CD platform without replacing it.
* Developers can run CI/CD pipelines as they developer (shift left)
* Developers can participate in creating their own pipelines
* something something standardize something something platform


### 

Develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.

### Runs your pipelines in containers

Dagger executes your pipelines entirely asÂ [standard OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org/). This has several benefits:

* **Superior caching**: every operation is cached by default, and caching works the same everywhere
* **Compatibility** with the Docker ecosystem: if it runs in a container, you can add it to your pipeline.
* **Cross-language instrumentation**: teams can use each other's tools without learning each other's language.

## Who is it for?

Dagger may be a good fit if you are...

* A developer wishing your CI pipelines were code instead of YAML
* Your team's "designated devops person", hoping to replace a pile of artisanal scripts with something more powerful
* A platform engineer writing custom tooling, with the goal of unifying continuous delivery across organizational silos
* A cloud-native developer advocate or solutions engineer, looking to demonstrate a complex integration on short notice
