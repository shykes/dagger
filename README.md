# Dagger

Dagger is a CI/CD engine that is both **programmable** and **container-native**.

* **Programmable**: develop your CI/CD pipelines as code, in the same programming language as your application.
* **Container-native**: Dagger runs your pipelines in [standard OCI containers](https://opencontainers.org), also known as "docker containers". This allows running the same pipeline on your local machine, CI runner, or any OCI-compatible system. Other benefits include superior caching; cross-language instrumentation; and more.
