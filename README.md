## What is Dagger?

Dagger is a tool that runs CI/CD pipelines in containers, anywhere.

* Run your pipelines locally before pushing them to CI. (solves "push and pray")
* Parity between dev and CI (solves "it worked on my machine")
* Reproducible dev environments (solves "how do I get started?")
* Use the same language to develop your apps and pipelines (solves "I don't know how our CI works")
* Composable API extensions (solves "just one more script!")
* Cross-language linking (solves "10 teams, 10 islands")
* Simplify your pipelines (solves "scripts wrapping yaml wrapping more scripts")
* Transparent caching. All operations are cached by default, and caching works the same in all environments.
* Reduce CI lock-in. Dagger runs on all major CI platforms, no proprietary DSL needed.

## Benefits to platform teams

* Reduce CI lock-in. Dagger functions run on all major CI platforms - no proprietary DSL needed.
* Don't be a bottleneck. Let app teams write their own functions. Enable standardization by providing them a library of reusable components.
* Faster CI runs. CI pipelines that are "Daggerized" typically run 2x to 10x faster, thanks to caching and concurrency. This means developers waste less time waiting for CI, and you spend less money on CI compute.
* A viable platform strategy. App teams need flexibility, and you need control. Dagger gives you a way to reconcile the two, in an incremental way that leverages the stack you already have.
